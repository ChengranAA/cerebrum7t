## Description

Implementation of the paper "CEREBRUM-7T: fast and fully-volumetric  brain segmentation of 7 Tesla MR volumes" ([link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.07.191536v1.full)).

</p>

In the paper, we tackle the problem of automatic 7T MRI segmentation. 
The generated model is able to produce accurate multi-structure segmentation masks on six different classes, in only few seconds.
Classes are: gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), ventricles, cerebellum, brainstem, and basal ganglia.
